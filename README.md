  ```yay -S ddnsc```



Configuration
-------------

Multiple DNS providers, domains, and hosts/subdomains are supported. The configuration file, which is typically located in /etc/ddnsc/ddnsc.conf, has the following format:

```
[global]
interval=300
use=web

[example.com]
provider=LuaDNS
email=EMAIL
key=KEY
hosts=@,blah,bazz
ttl=200

[bar.com]
provider=LuaDNS
email=EMAIL
key=KEY
hosts=@,foo
ttl=600
```

The `global` section is required, and an arbitrary number of subsequent sections after that are supported where each section title is the zone/domain to update. Hosts/subdomains to update are listed under each section. The `@` denotes updating the zone/domain itself. If the `@` were omitted from the `[example.com]` section in the example above, then only the A records for blah.example.com and bazz.example.com would be updated, and the A record for `example.com` would *not* be updated.
